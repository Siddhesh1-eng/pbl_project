# AI-Based Multi-Modal Examination Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a real-time AI-based proctoring system using Computer Vision techniques.

The system detects suspicious behavior during online examinations by analyzing:

- Head Pose Estimation
- Face Presence
- Multiple Face Detection
- Behavioral Anomaly Tracking
- Suspicion Scoring Engine

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- Real-time head pose tracking (Yaw & Pitch)
- Left / Right / Down detection
- Face absence detection
- Multiple face detection
- Temporal smoothing to reduce flickering
- Weighted suspicion scoring mechanism

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- YOLO-based phone detection
- Audio anomaly detection
- Gaze tracking
- Web-based dashboard
- Report generation system
